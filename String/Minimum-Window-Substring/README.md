# Minimum Window Substring
## **Problem Statment:**

Given two strings *s* and *t* of lengths *m* and *n* respectively, return the **minimum window substring** of *s* such that every character in *t* **(including duplicates)** is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string *""*.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is *unique*.

A *substring* is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

Example-1:

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```
