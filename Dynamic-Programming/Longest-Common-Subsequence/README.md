# Longest Common Subsequence
## **Problem Statment:**

Given two strings *text1* and *text2*, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return *0*.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

* For example, **"ace"** is a subsequence of **"abcde"**.

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example-1:

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```
