# Rotate Image
## **Problem Statment:**

You are given an *n x n* 2D *matrix* representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image *in-place*, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. *DO NOT* allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example-1:

```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
```
