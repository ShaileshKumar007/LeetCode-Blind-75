## Goal of this repository🎯
There are many repositories on GitHub that contain a collection of algorithms and data structures in different programming languages. 

This repository is based on the Blind-75 questions of Leetcode. Blind 75 leetcode is a list of 75 most frequent asked leetcode questions which had helped many developers clear interviews of Google, Facebook, Amazon etc. Hence, it is a tried and tested list with 1000s of testimonials available on all public review platforms such as quora, teamblind etc.

This repository will help folks in implemeting the Blind-75 questions in different programming languages. Here, folks can solve these questions in any programming language and make a PR for that. It will help students and this repo will act as a one stop repository where folks can see problems and solutions of most asked questions in different programming languages.
