Hacktoberfest Is Digitalocean‚Äôs Annual Event That Encourages People To Contribute To Open Source Throughout October. Much Of Modern Tech Infrastructure‚Äîincluding Some Of Digitalocean‚Äôs Own Products‚Äîrelies On Open-source Projects Built And Maintained By Passionate People Who Often Don‚Äôt Have The Staff Or Budgets To Do Much More Than Keep The Project Alive. Hacktoberfest Is All About Giving Back To Those Projects, Sharpening Skills, And Celebrating All Things Open Source, Especially The People That Make Open Source So Special.

For The Past 9 Years, Thousands Of People‚Äîcoders And Non-coders Alike‚Äîhave Participated In Hacktoberfest To Support The Projects They Use And Love, Learn And Practice Skills That Will Enhance Their Careers, And Meet New People Who Love Open Source As Much As They Do.


This repo is aimed at people who are new to Open-Source, earn and learn from that experience.

## Goal of this repositoryüéØ
There are many repositories on GitHub that contain a collection of algorithms and data structures in different programming languages. 

This repository is based on the Blind-75 questions of Leetcode. Blind 75 leetcode is a list of 75 most frequent asked leetcode questions which had helped many developers clear interviews of Google, Facebook, Amazon etc. Hence, it is a tried and tested list with 1000s of testimonials available on all public review platforms such as quora, teamblind etc.

This repository will help folks in implemeting the Blind-75 questions in different programming languages. Here, folks can solve these questions in any programming language and make a PR for that. It will help students and this repo will act as a one stop repository where folks can see problems and solutions of most asked questions in different programming languages.
